FRDM backend SSR

NOTE : email works for reset password, warning and content publishing but i didnt restricted the signup with email it was worth trying though the signup with login was worth it but publically hosting my site blocked smtp by default in the production render deployment.

email has two environments: production and development
production---> gmail smtp
development===> mailtrap smtp

if mailtrap dont work try using the other account for mailtrap hence, to make it work finally.

//RENDER HOSTS THIS SITE AND WE GET UPDATED DATA IN MONDODB ATLAS SO IT IS COOL, AND FAST ALSO, SSR IS COOL HERE.
